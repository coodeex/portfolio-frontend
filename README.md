Hello :wave: this is my portfolio project and it is live https://juhanilehto.herokuapp.com/ (first load is slow due to free hosting)

At the moment there is two pages home and about. In the future, there will also be a "play"-page containing a memory game, which is currently commented out in <a href="https://github.com/coodeex/portfolio-frontend/blob/master/src/components/Nav.js">/src/components/Nav.js</a> file, because the backend for highscores is not ready. By uncommenting the "play"-page it is already possible to play the memory game.
